OO basic:
- Abstraction
- Encapsulation
- Polymorphism
- Inheritence

OO Principles:
- Encapsulate what varies
- Favor composition over inheritance
- Program to interfaces, not implementations

OO Patterns:
STRATEGY - defines family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and make them interchangeable. 
Strategy lets the algorithm vary independently from clients that use it.
